# BASIC CLONE
## Introduction
This is a clone of the 1980's Apple basic programming langauge. It is not complete and propably never will be complete to the specs of the original. Its just a side project of mine so it won't live up to industry standart of wirting programming langauges.
## Install
1. *git clone* this repo from master if not stated otherwise
2. start is with *cargo run*
3. Enjoy!
## Usage and Getting Started
After you ran the rust programm you will be greeted with the __Bad Basic__ shell. Like in the original closing bracets (__]__) shows the lines you are working in and the commands you used in this session. Like in the original you have to specify a line number in the beginning otherwise nothing will work
